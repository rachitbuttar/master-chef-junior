🍰 Ingredients To Make Chocolate Cake 🍰
1.  2 cups all-purpose flour

2.  2 cups white sugar

3.  ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa

4.  2 teaspoons baking soda

5.  1 teaspoon baking powder

6.  ½ teaspoon salt

7.  2 eggs

8.  1 cup cold brewed coffee

9.  1 cup milk

10.  ½ cup vegetable oil

11.  2 teaspoons vinegar

💡 Directions 💡
Step 1:   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.

Step 2:   In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, coffee, milk, oil and vinegar. Mix until smooth; the batter will be thin. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Step 3:   Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
